WallTalk is a system that projects (grand)children’s Facebook content on the wall of elderly. The Facebook content of each (grand)child is projected around a physical photo frame, containing a picture of that (grand)child; adding value to the familiarity of physical photo frames. Elderly can ‘like’ and ‘comment’ on this Facebook content in an intuitive manner: by smiling and speaking.
