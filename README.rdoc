A high quality relationship between elderly and their (grand)children can be beneficial for all generations involved. However, a communication barrier exists between the younger and older generations, because each generation prefers different communication methods. This can negatively influence the grandparent-(grand)child relationship. To address this problem, WallTalk is developed: a system that aims to connect elderly with their (grand)children, in a way that is suitable for all generations involved. WallTalk projects (grand)children's Facebook content on the wall of elderly. The Facebook content of each (grand)child is projected around a physical photo frame containing a picture of that (grand)child. Elderly can 'like' and 'comment' on this Facebook content in an intuitive manner: by smiling and speaking.
